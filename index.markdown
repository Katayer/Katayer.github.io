Enthusiastic and organised student recently relocated to Sydney, with hands-on experience in
customer service and hospitality. Skilled at maintaining composure and resolving conflicts with
challenging customers, as well as thriving under pressure in fast-paced environments. Seeking a part-
time or casual role with hours that can fit around study commitments (ideally weekends) to further
develop my skills while contributing to a dynamic team.
